A social media style app designed to help League of Legends players improve.
Users can link (and verify) their League of Legends account to the app. The posts for the social media consist of 
matches from their League of Legends account, for which users are requesting feedback in the comment section.
Created an explore page, where users can browse through the latest posts.
Used Riot Games API to get information regarding League of Legends accounts.
I am planning to launch this as soon as the styling is ready. The social media logic is fully functional now.
